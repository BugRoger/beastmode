# Changelog

All notable changes to beastmode.

---

### v0.14.12 — The Argument Docs (Mar 2026)

- **Retro loop doc** — Dedicated argumentative essay at `docs/retro-loop.md` covering the self-improving retro mechanism
- **Configurable gates doc** — Dedicated argumentative essay at `docs/configurable-gates.md` covering progressive autonomy through gates
- **README integration** — All three differentiator sections in "What's Different" now link to their full argument docs


### v0.14.9 — The Banner Fix, For Real This Time (Mar 2026)

- **L0 Prime Directive** — Banner display instruction moved to BEASTMODE.md (autoloaded) with BEFORE-priority wording
- **Task-runner cleanup** — Removed dead Session Banner Check step; @import indirection never auto-expanded
- **Root cause** — Prior fixes targeted wording (v0.14.5) and task-runner (v0.14.6), but the real issue was @import non-expansion in HARD-GATE sections


### v0.14.8 — The Declutter (Mar 2026)

- **Remove CONTEXT.md** — L0 domain entry for Context removed; routing table duplicated by hierarchy conventions, zero consumers
- **Remove STATE.md** — L0 domain entry for State removed; kanban unused, `/beastmode:status` covers status needs


### v0.14.6 — The Banner Fix (Mar 2026)

- **Task-runner banner check** — New Step 1 in task-runner.md checks system context for SessionStart banner and displays it before skill execution
- **Prime Directive cleanup** — Removed redundant banner display directive from BEASTMODE.md; task-runner is sole owner
- **ANSI stripping** — Banner display strips escape codes so code blocks render cleanly


### v0.14.4 — The Format Standard (Mar 2026)

- **L1/L2/L3 format spec** — All context files standardized as rule-lists: dense summaries + numbered NEVER/ALWAYS rules
- **L3 context records** — New record format (Context/Decision/Rationale/Source) at `context/{phase}/{domain}/{record}.md`
- **Hierarchy table update** — L3 = Records, state removed from hierarchy levels in BEASTMODE.md
- **@imports removed** — All L1/L2 context files use convention-based paths
- **Retro format enforcement** — Context walker gains Format Enforcement section with `format_violation` finding type
- **Rule-writing principles** — Anti-bloat rules documented in retro agent: absolute directives, concrete rules, bullets over paragraphs


### v0.14.3 — The Write Guard (Mar 2026)

- **Write protection rule** — Phases write only to L3 state; retro is the sole gatekeeper for L0/L1/L2 promotion
- **Release L0 migration** — BEASTMODE.md updates flow through L3 proposal + retro promotion instead of direct write
- **Retro L0 promotion** — New step 10 applies L0 update proposals during release phase retro
- **Config gate** — `retro.l2-write` controls L2 context file creation during retro

### v0.14.2 — The Gap Detector (Mar 2026)

- **L2 gap detection** — Context walker gains Gap Detection Protocol with structured `context_gap` output type, confidence scoring, and accumulation-based promotion thresholds
- **Gap proposal processing** — Retro phase gains step 9 for processing context gap findings: logs gaps to learnings, gates file creation via `retro.l2-write`, creates approved L2 files with session-seeded content
- **New HITL gate** — `retro.l2-write` gate (default: human) controls L2 file creation approval

### v0.14.1 — The Agent's Handbook (Mar 2026)

- **L0 rework** — BEASTMODE.md rewritten as agent survival guide: prime directives, persona, workflow, knowledge hierarchy, domains, configuration
- **CLAUDE.md simplified** — Reduced to single `@.beastmode/BEASTMODE.md` import
- **Prime directives consolidated** — Moved from CLAUDE.md into BEASTMODE.md where they survive compression
- **Internal mechanisms removed** — Loading tables, compaction flow, writing guidelines, meta domain structure stripped from L0

### v0.14.0 — The Hierarchy Cleanup (Mar 2026)

- **BEASTMODE.md replaces L0 trio** — Single system manual (~108 lines) replaces PRODUCT.md, META.md, and .beastmode/CLAUDE.md as the sole autoload
- **@imports removed** — All L1 files use convention-based paths instead of @imports for L2 navigation
- **Three data domains** — Product domain merged into Context via `context/design/product.md`; four domains simplified to three (State/Context/Meta)
- **Skill primes updated** — All 5 phases load `context/{PHASE}.md` + `meta/{PHASE}.md` during prime (BEASTMODE.md autoloaded separately)
- **Retro agents modernized** — Convention-based L2 discovery replaces @import parsing

### v0.12.2 — The Cleanup (Mar 2026)

- **Unified gate syntax** — `[GATE|id]` / `[GATE-OPTION|mode]` replaces old `Gate:` format across all 20 gates
- **Standardized SKILL.md template** — task runner as first line in HARD-GATE, no trailing @imports
- **Import semantics** — `@file` = mandatory import, `[name](path)` = reference link, documented in conventions.md
- **Worktree detection fix** — state file reads now happen after worktree entry in plan/implement primes
- **Stale steps removed** — `Role Clarity`, `Load Prior Decisions`, prose `@` references cleaned up

### v0.12.1 — The Audit (Mar 2026)
