# Changelog

All notable changes to beastmode.

---

### v0.101.0 — npx Installer (Apr 2026)

- **Install command** — `npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code-beastmode install` provides zero-friction plugin setup: prerequisite checks, bun auto-install, CLI linking, JSON config merging, and post-install verification
- **Uninstall command** — `npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code-beastmode uninstall` cleanly removes plugin config entries and CLI links
- **Plain Node.js entry point** — npx CLI (`src/npx-cli/`) runs as pure ESM `.mjs` with no TypeScript, no build step, and no external dependencies — works before bun is available
- **README update** — Add system requirements, npx install command, and uninstall instructions

---

### v0.100.0 — CLI Hook Commands (Apr 2026)

- **Portable hook commands** — Replace absolute `import.meta.dir` paths with `bunx beastmode hooks <name> [phase]` CLI commands in all settings builders, making hooks portable across machines, worktrees, and installation paths
- **Hooks dispatch command** — Add `beastmode hooks <name> [phase]` CLI entry point that dispatches to hitl-auto, hitl-log, generate-output, and file-permission-settings handlers
- **HITL builder updates** — Update PreToolUse, PostToolUse, and file-permission builders to emit `bunx beastmode hooks` instead of `bun run <absolute-path>`
- **Git-initialized test dirs** — Fix integration tests to call `git init` in temp dirs before invoking CLI hook commands that internally use `git rev-parse`

---

### v0.99.0 — Fix Hook Paths (Apr 2026)

- **Absolute hook paths** — Replace fragile shell `$(dirname "$0")` substitution with `import.meta.dirname` in HITL and file-permission hook builders, making hook paths absolute and portable across worktrees
- **Remove static Stop hook** — Remove obsolete Stop hook from both `settings.json` and `hooks/hooks.json`; all hooks now generated into `settings.local.json` at dispatch time
- **Null guard fixes** — Add null guards for optional `file-permissions` config section in `config.ts` and pipeline runner timeout lookups

---

### v0.98.1 — README Refresh (Apr 2026)

- **HITL config example** — Replace fictional gates config in README with real `hitl:` structure from config.yaml
- **Domain list correction** — Fix domain attribution from "Meta" to "Research" in README knowledge hierarchy section
- **README accuracy test** — Add integration test validating README config examples and domain descriptions match actual project structure

---

### v0.98.0 — Dashboard Log Fixes (Apr 2026)

- **CLI verbosity filter** — CLI root entries now pass through `shouldShowEntry` so they respect the dashboard verbosity toggle instead of always rendering
- **Event routing and levels** — Add optional `level` field to `LogEntry`; lifecycle events route to the correct log with proper severity (debug for heartbeats, warn for dead sessions, error for failures); remove dual-write pattern
- **Version display** — Capture plugin version from the `started` lifecycle event and render it below the clock in the NyanBanner header

---

### v0.97.0 — Epic Sort by Date (Apr 2026)

- **compareEpics comparator** — Sort epics by most recent commit timestamp (descending), with slug-based tiebreaker for deterministic ordering
- **listEnrichedFromStore sort** — Apply compareEpics in the shared data layer so all consumers (dashboard, CLI) get sorted epics automatically
- **Integration test** — BDD scenario covering date-based epic ordering contract

---

### v0.96.0 — Static HITL Hooks (Apr 2026)

- **Command-type hooks** — Replace prompt-based HITL hooks with static command-type hooks; `buildPreToolUseHook(phase)` emits `type: "command"` entries instead of prompt injection
- **hitl-auto.ts** — Standalone auto-answer script that reads config at runtime, enabling config changes without hook regeneration
- **BDD integration tests** — Full Cucumber test suite for static HITL hook behavior with path resolution fixes

---

### v0.95.0 — Dashboard Extensions (Apr 2026)

- **Tree refactor** — Flatten tree hierarchy from Epic > Phase > Feature to CLI > Epic > Feature; phase displayed as colored badge, not tree level
- **Epics tree expansion** — Flat row model with `buildFlatRows` and `rowSlugAtIndex`; single-expand toggle, feature status colors
- **Details panel** — Renamed from OverviewPanel; context-sensitive content by selection type (all/epic/feature), artifact loading, PgUp/PgDn scroll

- **Dashboard adoption** — `useDashboardTreeState` adapter transforms existing ring buffer entries + session events into tree state, swapping only the rendering layer while preserving data flow
- **Watch integration** — `WatchTreeApp` Ink component with `attachTreeSubscriber` for WatchLoop-to-tree wiring; `--plain` flag and non-TTY detection fall back to flat format
- **Tree format functions** — `formatTreeLogLine` simplified output (no phase/scope columns since tree position conveys hierarchy); tree data types with depth-aware prefix rendering

- **Write Plan** — Replaces implicit task decomposition with a visible `.tasks.md` document containing complete code, TDD cycles, file structure mapping, and strict no-placeholder rule; self-review pass scans for spec coverage, forbidden patterns, and naming consistency before dispatch
- **Agent Review Pipeline** — Three dedicated agent files (implementer, spec-reviewer, quality-reviewer) with four-status model (DONE, DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, NEEDS_CONTEXT, BLOCKED) and two-stage ordered review: spec compliance reads actual code before quality review runs
- **Branch Isolation** — Isolated implementation branches per feature (`feature/<slug>/<feature>`) with per-task commits; checkpoint rebases back to worktree branch with auto-retry conflict resolution agent
- **Subagent Safety** — Agents commit on impl branch only, never on worktree branch; branch verification in Prime ensures correct checkout before dispatch

- **`slugify()` / `isValidSlug()`** — Centralized format validation in the manifest store
- **Collision resolution** — Deterministic `<epic>-<hex>` suffix when slugs collide
- **Single `store.save()` persist** — One call per dispatch; no more multiple writes or mid-transaction divergence
- **`output.json` as sole LLM-to-CLI channel** — Replaces commit-message regex parsing

- **Cancelled phase sync** — Cancelled epics map to Done board column, get `phase/cancelled` label, and close on GitHub just like done epics

### v0.51.0 — XState Pipeline Machine (Mar 2026)

- **XState v5 epic machine** — Explicit state machine with 7 states (design → plan → implement → validate → release → done/cancelled), named guards (`hasFeatures`, `allFeaturesCompleted`, `outputCompleted`), and declarative actions (`persist`, `enrichManifest`, `renameSlug`, `syncGitHub`) via `setup()` API
- **Feature status machine** — Separate 4-state machine (pending → in-progress → completed → blocked) for feature lifecycle
- **State metadata dispatch** — Watch loop reads `meta.dispatchType` from actor snapshot instead of `deriveNextAction()` — single source of truth for what each state means
- **Snapshot persistence** — `getSnapshot()` → JSON → `createActor(machine, { snapshot })` round-trip, same `.manifest.json` format, zero migration
- **Consumer swap** — `post-dispatch.ts` reduced to thin event router, `watch-command.ts` reads dispatch from actor meta, `state-scanner.ts` uses actor for state resolution
- **Validate regression** — `VALIDATE_FAILED` as explicit implement ← validate transition with feature reset
- **Cancel from any state** — `CANCEL` event valid from any non-terminal state with `markCancelled` + `persist` actions
- **835 tests** — Comprehensive coverage across transitions, guards, actions, persistence round-trips, and integration flows

### v0.50.0 — Context Tree Compaction (Mar 2026)

- **Retro value-add gate** — Both retro walkers (context, meta) now check four criteria before creating L3 records: rationale, constraints, provenance, dissenting context. Redundant L3s that merely restate their parent L2 are silently skipped
- **Compaction agent** — New utility agent (`agents/compaction.md`) audits the full context tree with three ordered operations: staleness removal, L3 restatement folding, and L0 promotion detection for rules duplicated across 3+ phases
- **`beastmode compact` CLI** — On-demand context tree audit command, always runs regardless of release cadence
- **Release compaction integration** — Automatic compaction every 5 releases, runs before retro in checkpoint phase to prevent creating-then-immediately-deleting records

### v0.49.0 — Watch Output Noise (Mar 2026)

- **Centralized logger** — New `createLogger(verbosity, slug)` factory in `cli/src/logger.ts` with level-gated methods: `log()` (L0), `detail()` (L1), `debug()` (L2), `trace()` (L3), `warn()`/`error()` (stderr)
- **Verbosity flags** — `-v`/`-vv`/`-vvv` flag parsing on all CLI commands (watch, phase, cancel, status)
- **Full call-site migration** — All 70 `console.log`/`console.error` calls replaced with logger equivalents across 13 CLI files
- **Consistent output format** — `HH:MM:SS slug: message` across all commands
- **stderr/stdout split** — warn/error always write to stderr, info/debug to stdout
- **Fix** — Restored feature-isolation guards removed during call-site migration

### v0.48.0 — Slugless Design Entry (Mar 2026)

- **Slugless design entry** — `beastmode design` takes no arguments; generates random hex temp slug, asks "What are you trying to solve?" before any codebase exploration
- **Slug proposal gate** — Design checkpoint proposes a slug after decision tree completion, user confirms or overrides via gated decision
- **Post-dispatch rename** — CLI reads real slug from output.json and renames worktree dir, git branch, manifest file, manifest internals, and PRD artifact
- **Auto-suffix collision handling** — `-v2` through `-v99` when slug collides with existing worktree/branch
- **Graceful rename failure** — System continues under hex name if rename fails
- **Artifact rename fix** — Renamed artifacts from `slugless-design` to `design-assumptions-less-of-them-v2` for consistency

### v0.47.0 — iTerm2 Dispatch Strategy (Mar 2026)

- **iTerm2 dispatch strategy** — New `dispatch-strategy: iterm2` uses the `it2` CLI for native tab-per-epic and split-pane-per-phase pipeline visibility in iTerm2
- **It2Client wrapper** — Typed wrapper for `it2` CLI commands (create-tab, split-pane, close-pane, list-sessions) with full pane lifecycle management
- **ITermSessionFactory** — Implements `SessionFactory` interface for iTerm2 tab/pane creation, cleanup, and reconciliation
- **Auto-detection chain** — `dispatch-strategy: auto` now prioritizes iTerm2 (if detected + it2 available) before cmux and SDK
- **Environment detection** — Detects iTerm2 via `ITERM_SESSION_ID` and `TERM_PROGRAM` env vars
- **Startup reconciliation** — Reconciles existing `bm-*` tabs/panes from previous runs on watch startup
- **Badge notifications** — iTerm2 badge notifications for errors and blocked gates
- **GitHub sync fix** — Runtime discovery replaces manual config IDs

### v0.46.1 — Design Retro Always (Mar 2026)

- **Always-run design retro** — Design checkpoint now includes a `SKIP SECTION` directive that bypasses the Quick-Exit Check, ensuring every design session produces L2/L3 knowledge records regardless of session size

### v0.46.0 — Status Watch (Mar 2026)

- **Live watch mode** — `beastmode status --watch` / `-w` turns the one-shot status command into a live-updating terminal dashboard that polls manifest state every 2 seconds
- **Change highlighting** — Rows that transitioned since last poll render with bold/inverse for one cycle, then revert
- **Dashboard header** — Shows watch loop running indicator (lockfile-based detection) and blocked gate details per epic
- **Render refactor** — Extracted status table rendering into a reusable pure function, separated render logic from command handler
- **Pipeline fixes** — Fixed GitHub sync race conditions, feature isolation in dispatch fan-out, YAML parser quote stripping, cmux session feature-specific output detection, and epic-scoped output provenance

### v0.45.0 — GitHub No For Real Sync (Mar 2026)

- **Reconciling factory** — Extract state reconciliation and release teardown from `dispatchPhase` into `ReconcilingFactory`, eliminating duplication between SDK and cmux paths
- **Cmux dispatch strategy** — `watchCommand` reads `dispatch-strategy` from config, wires `CmuxSessionFactory` when cmux is available with graceful fallback
- **Output.json scan-all** — Stop hook scans ALL artifact .md files with frontmatter instead of only the most recent; uses mtime comparison for efficiency
- **Epic-level worktrees** — `dispatchPhase` always uses epic-level worktree slug, removing per-feature worktree creation
- **Implement checkpoint wording** — Clarify "Next:" handoff message

### v0.44.3 — Slim Down Design (Mar 2026)

- **Remove prior-decisions gate** — Deleted `[GATE|design.prior-decisions]` from design prime phase; design interviews now start without accumulated rules biasing the conversation
- **Config cleanup** — Removed `prior-decisions: auto` from `gates.design` in config.yaml
- **Step renumbering** — Renumbered prime phase steps (4 -> 3, 5 -> 4) for contiguous ordering

### v0.44.2 — README & ROADMAP Accuracy Fix (Mar 2026)

- **Config example fix** — README config.yaml example now shows real gate names; removed deleted `transitions:` block
- **Domain description fix** — Corrected domain list to three: Artifacts, Context, Meta
- **"What Beastmode Is NOT" section** — Added positioning section after "Why?" to clarify scope
- **ROADMAP "Now" update** — Added CLI orchestrator, cmux integration, GitHub state model, terminal phase states, manifest split, demo recording
- **ROADMAP cleanup** — Removed shipped/deleted items (phase auto-chaining, visual language spec); updated "Next"/"Later" to reflect current state

### v0.44.1 — README & ROADMAP Accuracy Fix (Mar 2026)

- **Config example fix** — README config.yaml example now shows real gate names; removed deleted `transitions:` block
- **Domain description fix** — Corrected domain list to three: Artifacts, Context, Meta

- **ROADMAP "Now" update** — Added CLI orchestrator, cmux integration, GitHub state model, terminal phase states, manifest split, demo recording
- **ROADMAP cleanup** — Removed shipped/deleted items (phase auto-chaining, visual language spec); updated "Next"/"Later" to reflect current state

### v0.44.0 — Terminal Phase States (Mar 2026)

- **Terminal phases** — `done` and `cancelled` added as first-class Phase values; `shouldAdvance` returns `"done"` for completed releases, `deriveNextAction` returns null for both terminal phases
- **Type-safe cancel** — `cancel()` no longer needs `as Phase` cast; `"cancelled"` is a valid Phase
- **GitHub Done sync** — `PHASE_TO_BOARD_STATUS` maps `done` to "Done" column; epic issues auto-close on completion
- **Status filtering** — `buildStatusRows` hides done/cancelled epics by default; `--all` flag shows full history
- **Phase styling** — `colorPhase` green+dim for done, red+dim for cancelled; PHASE_ORDER positions done below active work
- **Scanner reconciliation** — Pre-reconcile worktree outputs in scanner to prevent stale data; preserve manifests after release

### v0.43.0 — Orchestrator State Reconciliation (Mar 2026)

- **Orchestrator-driven state reconciliation** — Watch loop reconciles state by scanning worktree plan files directly instead of parsing output.json; the orchestrator is the sole writer of pipeline state
- **Explicit phase advancement map** — `NEXT_PHASE` constant map replaces ad-hoc phase transition logic
- **Plan reconciliation** — Scans worktree for feature plan `.md` files and enriches the manifest automatically
- **Artifact copying** — Copies plan files from worktree to git-tracked `artifacts/plan/` for downstream agents
- **Dead code removal** — Removed `findWorktreeOutputFile`, `loadWorktreePhaseOutput`, `shouldAdvance`/`regressPhase` imports, stale release re-dispatch test, and unused manifest-store exports

### v0.42.1 — Polling Behaviour (Mar 2026)

- **Async dispatch mutex design** — PRD for promise-based async mutex serializing concurrent `tick()` and `rescanEpic()` calls in the watch loop, closing a check-then-act race condition
- **Dispatch mutex plan** — Feature plan for global async mutex in `WatchLoop` with acquire/release semantics and wait-queue contention model
- **Concurrent dispatch test plan** — Feature plan for CI test proving mutex serialization: simultaneous `tick()` + `rescanEpic()` asserts exactly one `sessionFactory.create()` call
- **Housekeeping** — Removed stale `.beastmode-runs.json`, added to `.gitignore`, fixed plugin update scope in release skill

### v0.42.0 — Manifest File Management (Mar 2026)

- **Pure manifest state machine** — Split `manifest.ts` into pure state transitions and new `manifest-store.ts` filesystem boundary; pipeline logic is fully testable without disk IO
- **Consumer migration** — All CLI modules (watch, status, cancel, phase, github-sync, reconcile-startup, post-dispatch) rewritten against new manifest API
- **Directory restructure** — Historical state artifacts moved from `.beastmode/state/` to `.beastmode/artifacts/`; pipeline manifests live in `.beastmode/pipeline/`
- **Stop hook** — Graceful agent termination via `.claude/settings.json` hook; agents can be stopped mid-phase without corruption
- **Structured blocked state** — `blocked` field upgraded from boolean to `{ gate, reason } | null` with full context
- **Phase regression** — `regressPhase()` allows stepping backward on validate failure instead of manual restart
- **EnrichedManifest type** — Replaces legacy `EpicState`, `FeatureProgress`, `SkippedManifest` with single canonical type
- **Skill checkpoint contracts** — Implement tasks write `.output.json` files for downstream phase consumption
- **Release worktree ops** — `archive()` and `merge()` exports restored in `worktree.ts` for release teardown
- **Immutable github-sync** — Returns mutations instead of mutating manifest in-place
- **Release version deferral** — Version bumping moved to post-merge checkpoint on main; worktree no longer touches version files

### v0.41.0 — The Status Unfuckery, Part II (Mar 2026)

- **Pipeline-only discovery** — Scanner reads pipeline/ manifests exclusively; design-file discovery removed, dropping ~118 zombie epics from status output
- **Manifest.phase authority** — Phase derivation reads `manifest.phase` directly; missing/invalid phase causes strict reject (manifest skipped)
- **Shared manifest validation schema** — TypeScript validator used by both scanner (read) and reconciler (write); required fields: phase, design, features, lastUpdated
- **Single EpicState type** — Canonical interface in state-scanner.ts; watch-types.ts duplicate deleted
- **Unified blocked field** — Single `blocked: boolean` replaces gateBlocked/blockedGate/gateName
- **Compact status table** — Redesigned: Epic | Phase | Features (done/total) | Status with color output
- **--verbose flag** — Surfaces skipped manifests and validation errors
- **Feature status validation** — Rejects unknown status values instead of casting any string
- **Cost tracking removed** — costUsd, aggregateCost, readRunLog removed from scanner and status
- **Test suite rewrite** — 362 tests, 728 assertions across 20 files

### v0.40.0 — The Great Unbundling (Mar 2026)

- **Merge coordinator deleted** — Removed `merge-coordinator.ts` (328 lines) and all associated types, functions, and tests; CLI no longer drives git merges
- **Worktree ops stripped** — Removed `merge()` and `archive()` from `worktree.ts`; module reduced to create, enter, ensureWorktree, exists, remove
- **Watch fan-out simplified** — Implement fan-out dispatches all feature sessions to the same epic worktree instead of creating per-feature branches
- **Release/cancel teardown** — Release calls `removeWorktree()` only (no archive, no merge); cancel skips archive step entirely

### v0.39.0 — The Problem-Space Purification (Mar 2026)

- **Module sketch removal** — Removed Execute step 3 (module sketch) from design phase; design stays in problem-space (decisions, gray areas, user stories) without premature structural decomposition
- **Deep modules guidance** — Moved "deep modules" guidance (from A Philosophy of Software Design) to plan phase's architectural decisions step where it applies with actual codebase context
- **Reference cleanup** — Removed all module-related references from design SKILL.md, express path, executive summary template, and PRD template

### v0.38.0 — The Skill Cleanup (Mar 2026)

- **Checkpoint sync removal** — Removed orphaned "Sync GitHub" sections and `@../_shared/github.md` imports from all 5 checkpoint files; skills no longer reference the deleted shared GitHub utility
- **Status subcommand deletion** — Deleted `skills/beastmode/subcommands/status.md` and removed routing/help text from SKILL.md (status moved to CLI in v0.32.0)
- **Context doc update** — DESIGN.md GitHub State Model section updated to reflect skills are no longer GitHub-aware at checkpoint time

### v0.37.0 — The Fork Point (Mar 2026)

- **Fork-point tracking** — Worktrees fork from local main instead of stale `origin/HEAD`; fork-point SHA recorded in `WorktreeInfo` for audit trail
- **Main branch resolution** — `resolveMainBranch()` resolves default branch from `git symbolic-ref` with `"main"` fallback
- **Graceful degradation** — `forkPoint` set to `undefined` when `merge-base` fails (unrelated histories, missing branch)

### v0.36.0 — The Terminal Multiplexer (Mar 2026)

- **SessionStrategy interface** — Formal strategy pattern (`dispatch()`, `isComplete()`, `cleanup()`) with `SdkStrategy` and `CmuxStrategy` implementations
- **CmuxClient** — Typed CLI wrapper for the `cmux` binary with `--json` flag: `ping()`, `newWorkspace()`, `newSplit()`, `sendSurface()`, `closeSurface()`, `listWorkspaces()`, `notify()`
- **CmuxStrategy** — Workspace-per-epic surface model with `fs.watch` completion detection via `.dispatch-done.json` marker files
- **SessionFactory** — Strategy selection based on `cli.dispatch-strategy` config (`sdk | cmux | auto`) and runtime cmux availability
- **Startup reconciliation** — Adopts live cmux surfaces, closes dead ones, removes empty workspaces on watch restart
- **Surface cleanup** — Automatic workspace teardown when epic reaches release
- **Universal completion marker** — `phaseCommand` writes `.dispatch-done.json` regardless of dispatch method
- **Desktop notifications** — Error and blocked gate notifications via `cmux notify`
- **220 tests passing** — Full test coverage across all new modules

### v0.35.0 — The Status Unfuckery (Mar 2026)

- **Manifest structural validation** — Scanner validates required fields (design, features, lastUpdated) with correct types; malformed manifests skipped with warning instead of corrupting status output
- **Output.json phase detection** — Phase derivation uses checkpoint output.json files instead of legacy directory artifact scanning; waterfall: release > validate > implement-done > implement > plan > design
- **Watch command cleanup** — Removed seedPipelineState (stale manifest re-seeding) and dead scanEpicsInline fallback; watch loop imports state-scanner directly

### v0.34.0 — The Manifest-Only Status (Mar 2026)

- **Manifest-first scanner** — Epic discovery pivots on manifest files instead of design files; status table drops from ~116 noisy rows to ~12 active epics
- **Status cleanup** — Removed Cost column, readRunLog, formatCost; table simplified to 5 columns (Epic, Phase, Progress, Blocked, Last Activity)
- **Watch convergence** — Deleted scanEpicsInline() from watch-command.ts; watch loop delegates to canonical state-scanner.scanEpics()

### v0.33.0 — The Interactive Terminal (Mar 2026)

- **Interactive runner** — All five manual phase commands spawn interactive `claude` CLI sessions with inherited stdio; operators get a live terminal for every phase
- **Phase dispatch unification** — `phaseCommand()` simplified from ~270 lines with fan-out logic to uniform interactive dispatch; implement is no longer a special case

### v0.32.0 — The GitHub CLI Migration (Mar 2026)

- **Manifest redesign** — Pipeline manifest restructured as pure state: single epic, top-level phase, feature statuses, artifact refs; CLI is sole mutator
- **Phase output contract** — Skills write structured `.output.json` files to `state/<phase>/` at checkpoint; universal schema consumed by CLI to advance pipeline state
- **GitHub sync engine** — Stateless `syncGitHub(manifest, config)` runs post-dispatch; one-way mirror from manifest to GitHub with blast-replace labels and warn-and-continue error handling
- **Dispatch pipeline** — CLI reads phase outputs from worktree after dispatch, updates manifest, then syncs GitHub
- **Skill cleanup** — Deleted `skills/_shared/github.md`, removed GitHub sync from 5 checkpoint files and implement prime; skills are now fully GitHub-unaware and manifest-unaware

### v0.31.0 — The Worktree Transaction (Mar 2026)

- **CLI worktree lifecycle** — `ensureWorktree()` creates or reuses a single worktree per epic; all phases share it via cwd injection
- **Cancel command** — `beastmode cancel <slug>` archives branch tip, removes worktree, deletes local branch, updates manifest, closes GitHub epic
- **Skill worktree sweep** — Removed worktree references from ~16 skill files; skills receive feature slug as argument, never touch worktree internals
- **Justfile and hook deletion** — Deleted `Justfile`, `hooks/worktree-create.sh`, `skills/_shared/worktree-manager.md`; removed `WorktreeCreate` from `hooks/hooks.json`
- **Implement fan-out flattened** — Parallel SDK sessions share the epic worktree directly; no per-feature worktrees or merge-coordinator involvement

### v0.30.0 — The Bulletproof Scanner (Mar 2026)

- **Canonical scanner rewrite** — Single `state-scanner.ts` replaces divergent `scanEpicsInline()` in watch-command.ts; manifests are the sole epic anchor, no design file fallback
- **Manifest phase field** — Top-level `manifest.phase` (plan|implement|validate|release|released) replaces marker files and the `phases` map as the single source of truth for epic phase
- **Merge conflict auto-resolution** — Ours-side resolution strips git conflict markers before JSON.parse, preventing silent phase regressions from parallel worktree merges
- **Slug collision detection** — Warns on stderr when multiple manifests resolve to the same slug; uses newest manifest (last sorted by filename)
- **Graceful empty state** — Missing or empty pipeline directories return an empty array instead of crashing
- **Scanner test suite** — Comprehensive unit tests covering every phase transition, conflict resolution, slug collision, empty state, and blocked feature detection (124 tests)

### v0.29.0 — The Terminal Multiplexer (Mar 2026)

- **Dispatch abstraction** — `DispatchedSession` interface with `SdkSession` and `CmuxSession` implementations, `SessionFactory` for runtime strategy selection
- **CmuxSession implementation** — Workspace-per-epic surface model, Unix socket JSON-RPC client, lifecycle management (create workspace, create surface, send command, cleanup)
- **Validation** — 124 tests, 0 failures, clean type check

### v0.28.0 — The Worktree Takeover (Mar 2026)

- **Phase command** — `beastmode <phase> <slug>` replaces `beastmode run` and `just <phase>` as the sole entry point for phase execution
- **Worktree lifecycle** — CLI owns full lifecycle: create-once at first phase, persist through all phases, squash-merge to main and remove at release
- **Manifest module** — New `cli/src/manifest.ts` reads and manages pipeline manifests from worktrees
- **Implement fan-out** — Per-feature worktrees with `<epic>-<feature>` slug; merge-coordinator handles conflict simulation and optimal merge ordering
- **Release teardown** — CLI squash-merges epic branch to main, archives branch tip, removes worktree
- **Watch command alignment** — Watch loop uses same worktree lifecycle as manual execution, ensuring identical behavior

### v0.27.0 — The Design Trifecta (Mar 2026)

- **cmux integration PRD** — Unix socket JSON-RPC client, workspace-per-epic surface model, strategy pattern dispatch abstraction, optional dependency with zero regression risk

### v0.24.0 — The Epics-Only Board (Mar 2026)

- **Epics-only board model** — Removed `gh project item-add` calls for Feature issues from plan checkpoint, implement prime, and implement checkpoint; only Epics are added to the Projects V2 board
- **Existing feature cleanup** — Removed all existing Feature issues from the project board via `deleteProjectV2Item` GraphQL mutation (one-time ad-hoc cleanup)
- **Context doc updates** — `github-state-model.md` gains NEVER rule for Feature board-add; `DESIGN.md` summary updated to reflect epics-only model

### v0.23.0 — The Project Board (Mar 2026)

- **Pipeline status field** — Setup-github creates a 7-option Pipeline field (Backlog, Design, Plan, Implement, Validate, Release, Done) with color-coded statuses via GraphQL
- **Project metadata cache** — Setup-github writes `.beastmode/state/github-project.cache.json` with project ID, field ID, and option ID map for downstream checkpoint use
- **Issue backfill** — Setup-github adds all existing `type/epic` and `type/feature` issues to the project with Status derived from their current labels

- **Checkpoint project sync** — All 5 phase checkpoints sync Epic and Feature issues to the project board at every transition
- **Cache field name fix** — Fixed `pipelineField` vs `statusField` naming inconsistency between cache writer and reader

### v0.22.0 — The External Orchestrator (Mar 2026)

- **Justfile orchestrator** — Thin CLI shell with recipes for each phase (`just design`, `just plan`, `just implement`, `just validate`, `just release`). Invokes `claude --worktree` interactively.
- **WorktreeCreate hook** — Smart branch detection: if `feature/<slug>` exists, branch from it; otherwise default `origin/HEAD` behavior
- **Skill purification** — Removed all worktree creation/entry/assertion logic and phase transition gates from every skill. Skills are now pure content processors.
- **Checkpoint handoff** — All 5 phase checkpoints print `just <next-phase> <slug>` instead of auto-chaining via `Skill()` calls
- **Commit-per-phase** — Each phase commits to the feature branch at checkpoint. Release squash-merges to main.
- **Config cleanup** — Removed `transitions` section from `.beastmode/config.yaml`

### v0.21.0 — The GitHub Phase Integration (Mar 2026)

- **Manifest-based state tracking** — JSON manifest created at design checkpoint, enriched at plan (features array + architectural decisions), updated at implement (feature status transitions). Local authority for feature lifecycle.
- **GitHub sync at checkpoints** — Optional "Sync GitHub" step in all 5 phase checkpoints creates/advances/closes Epic and Feature issues at checkpoint boundaries. Gated on `github.enabled` config toggle.
- **Setup subcommand update** — `/beastmode setup-github` now creates 12 labels (dropped status/review), Projects V2 board, and writes `github.enabled: true` to config
- **Warn-and-continue error handling** — All GitHub API calls wrapped in try/catch pattern: print warning, skip sync, continue with local state. Workflow never blocked by GitHub.
- **Status rewrite** — `/beastmode status` reads manifests from worktrees, shows per-feature status (pending/in-progress/blocked/completed) with GitHub issue links when enabled
- **Config extension** — New `github.enabled` (default: false) and `github.project-name` keys in `.beastmode/config.yaml`
- **Shared GitHub utility update** — Added error handling convention section and set-status-label operation to `_shared/github.md`

### v0.20.0 — The Feature Decomposition (Mar 2026)

- **PRD-to-features** — /plan now decomposes PRDs into independent architectural feature plans (vertical slices) instead of monolithic implementation plans
- **Feature manifest** — New manifest JSON tracks feature status, architectural decisions, and PRD link across all features in a design
- **Task decomposition moves to /implement** — Detailed wave/task breakdown now happens at implement time, not plan time, giving /implement full autonomy over execution strategy
- **Baseline-aware spec checks** — Implement tracks a baseline snapshot at prime to prevent false positives when features share a worktree
- **Manifest-gated validation** — /validate checks all features are completed via manifest before proceeding
- **Two-tier plan approval** — New `feature-set-approval` (human) and `feature-approval` (auto) gates replace the old single `plan-approval`
- **Feature format template** — New reference template for architectural feature plans: user stories, what to build, acceptance criteria (no file paths, no code)

### v0.19.0 — The PRD Pivot (Mar 2026)

- **Decision tree interviews** — /design now walks every branch of the design tree one question at a time with Claude's recommendation, replacing the old gray-area-first batch loop
- **Two-pass flow** — Full decision tree walk first, then gray area sweep as a second pass to catch big-picture blind spots the tree missed
- **Inline exploration** — Codebase reads and research happen during the interview instead of requiring separate triggers in prime
- **Module sketch step** — New step between interview and PRD writing identifies deep modules (encapsulate complexity behind simple testable interfaces)
- **Prior decisions gate** — New `design.prior-decisions` gate (default: auto) applies context/meta decisions silently so settled questions don't get re-asked
- **PRD output format** — Design artifacts now follow standardized PRD template: Problem Statement, Solution, User Stories, Implementation Decisions, Testing Decisions, Out of Scope, Further Notes, Deferred Ideas
- **New gate set** — Replaced 4 old design gates (intent-discussion, approach-selection, section-review, design-approval) with 4 new ones (decision-tree, gray-areas, prior-decisions, prd-approval)

### v0.18.0 — The GitHub State Model (Mar 2026)

- **GitHub state model** — Two-level issue hierarchy (Epic > Feature) with label-based state machines, externalizing workflow lifecycle to GitHub Issues and Projects V2
- **Shared GitHub utility** — Reusable API operations for auth, labels, issues, sub-issues, and Projects V2
- **Setup subcommand** — `/beastmode setup-github` bootstraps labels, project board, columns, repo linking (idempotent)
- **Config extension** — backlog-to-design and release-to-done transitions, github.project-name setting

### v0.17.0 — The Full Spectrum Init (Mar 2026)

- **17-domain skeleton** — Skeleton assets expanded from 7 to 17 L2 files covering design (4), plan (4), implement (3), validate (2), release (4), each with matching L3 directories and `.gitkeep`
- **Inventory agent expansion** — Detects all 17 domains with specific detection signals for 10 new domains (domain-model, error-handling, workflow, build, quality-gates, validation-patterns, versioning, changelog, deployment, distribution)
- **Writer agent retro-format** — L2 output switched from prose paragraphs to ALWAYS/NEVER bullets with em-dash rationale; L3 records use Context/Decision/Rationale format matching retro agents
- **Init retro phase** — New phase spawns retro-context agents (one per phase) after writers complete, processing state/ artifacts and populating meta/ files
- **Synthesize agent expansion** — Generates all 10 L1 files (5 context + 5 meta) instead of only context; meta L1 format mirrors context L1
- **5-phase init flow** — Init restructured from 3 phases (inventory → populate → synthesize) to 5 (skeleton → inventory → write → retro → synthesize)

### v0.16.0 — The Discovery Engine (Mar 2026)

- **Init system redesigned** — Replaced 5 narrow init agents + greenfield wizard with 3-phase layered discovery: Inventory (orchestrator reads all project knowledge) → Populate (parallel writers create L2 summaries + L3 records) → Synthesize (generates L1 summaries, rewrites CLAUDE.md)
- **Knowledge map architecture** — Inventory agent reads 7 source types (CLAUDE.md, README, docs, plans, source structure, git history, config files) and produces structured knowledge map with L2 topic assignments
- **L3 record creation** — Writer agents create L3 decision records with source attribution from all discoverable sources
- **Dynamic topic discovery** — Proposes new L2 topics when 3+ items cluster beyond the 6 base topics
- **Greenfield mode removed** — Empty projects get skeleton only and evolve through /design sessions

### v0.15.0 — The Hook Fix (Mar 2026)

- **Hook field removed from plugin.json** — The `hooks` reference to `./hooks/hooks.json` caused plugin loading issues; removed to restore correct behavior

### v0.14.38 — The Spring Cleaning (Mar 2026)

- **First-class init agents** — 5 init-* agents made self-contained with `@common-instructions.md` import; dispatched via registered `beastmode:init-*` types instead of manual prompt assembly
- **common-instructions.md relocated** — Moved from `skills/beastmode/references/discovery-agents/` to `agents/`
- **Brownfield dispatch simplified** — `init.md` prompt assembly + concatenation replaced with direct registered agent dispatch
- **Dead reference docs removed** — Deleted `gate-check.md` and `transition-check.md` (both "Reference Only — NOT @imported")

### v0.14.37 — The Gate Tightener (Mar 2026)

- **Structural HARD-GATE enforcement** — Worktree entry/creation sections wrapped in `<HARD-GATE>` tags with numbered procedure bullets, replacing verbose prose enforcement
- **Design worktree placement** — Worktree creation moved from design/1-execute to design/3-checkpoint (step 0), matching the phase's actual needs
- **Prime-first worktree entry** — plan/implement/validate/release enter worktree as step 1 of 0-prime, before announce or context load
- **Bare assert pattern** — validate/release 1-execute slimmed to one-line worktree-manager assert calls
